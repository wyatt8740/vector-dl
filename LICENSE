This uses almost the GPL version 3 license, but with the added restriction that
I do not provide consent or license for this to be incorporated into generative
AI training data or used in other ways for the creation of generative AI
models.

It is also forbidden for those using this code under this license to grant
permission for this to be incorporated into generative AI training data or used
in other ways for the creation of generative AI models.

If you really wish to use this for generative AI training, you must contact me
and request permission, which may be subject to further terms and/or monetary
compensation.

(This is intended to ensure no one tries to do it, but if you pay me enough I
wouldn't refuse).
